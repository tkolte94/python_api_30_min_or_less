# python_api_30_min_or_less
This repository is meant to work with a talk: Build a Python API in 30 min or less! It is meant to teach students with little to no experience with code how to organize their ideas into a proof of concept to improve their skills and their confidence in learning new frameworks!

### How To Set Up
Use the "Commands.txt" file to set up your environment.


Create your first API using the exampleapi.py file as a guide.


Run your application using the command: `uvicorn exampleapi:app --reload` . You can replace `exampleapi` with the name of your file.  This will run your app on `http://localhost:8000/`.


Now you can use test.py to test your application! You can also see what you've built out.
